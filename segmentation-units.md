# Tibetan text segmentation units

This short page tries to describe the different units used to segment a Tibetan text, and particularly the Kangyur and Tengyur.

This table summarizes the different units:

TODO

A **volume** (tib?) is a physical book, it is edition-dependant.

The **text** (tib?) is the most consensual unit, all editions have the same text segmentation (but not the same order nor the same number of texts).

The **page** (ཤོག) is edition-dependant.

The **line** (tib?) is edition-dependant.

The **syllable** (ཚིག) is a group of characters, syllables are separated by tshegs (་).

The **shloka** (tib?) is a group of 4 verses (ཚིག་རྐང་བཞི) when the text is in verse, or a group of 30 syllables when the text is in prose. As different editions may have differences in the text, shlokas are edition-dependant.

The **bampo** (བམ་པོ) is a group of 300 shlokas,and thus edition-dependant.

The **chapter** (ལེའུ) is a division of a text, written in the text itself, all editions have the same chapter.

The dechen ?

The **word** (tib?) is a group of characters (including tshegs). It is not marked in the text and the division may not be consensual. Many ambiguities prevent automatic word segmentation, ex: བར can be `བ + particle ར` or the word བར. Words can be inflected with affix particles (tib?) for instance བཀའི is word བཀའ + particle འི. There is thus no direct correspondance between group of syllables and word, but there is between words+affix particles and groups of syllables.

The **sentence** (ཚིག་སྒྲུབ) is a relatively new unit (the word itself is ~50 years old). Sentences are not noted in the text, and sentence segmentation is not consensual.

The **paragraph** (?) is a group of syllables ending by a སླར་བསྡུ particle.

## Table of content segmentation

Tibetan texts usually have a table of content (དཀར་ཆག) segmenting the text into different topics. Different table of contents may exist though, so this cannot be considered universal.


## Edition-independant references

It is necessary to have a common reference system allowing to reference all parts of texts in the Kangyur in an edition-independant way, similar to the reference system of the Bible. The problem is with texts in prose, as they have no consensual edition-independant units. A system is yet to be found.

## Concordance

Long term possibility: making something similar to [Strong's concordance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong%27s_Concordance) for the Kangyur and Tengyur. This would ease the constitution of glossaries, dictionnaries, etc. A first step is to cut the whole Kangyur into words and index them.
